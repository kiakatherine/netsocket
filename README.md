Sample code from Netsocket software-defined network GUI, with a side project thrown in.

The Netsocket project requires a lot of context and code to understand, and unfortunately I can't add all of that here, so
I try to give a general overview of the purpose of the code at the top of each file. Comments that I have added in order for those outside of Netsocket to better understand it begin with //*.

Enjoy!
